# Any data files that should not be committed (ee.g., if you were to store
# PDFs locally and not want them in Git, or if ChromaDB was local)
# For this project, as we're using Supabase, no local DB files are created.
# If you use the PDFLoader and store PDFs in a 'data' folder locally,
# and you DON'T want those PDFs committed to Git (e.g., if they are very large
# or sensitive), you would add:
# /data/*.pdf
# /data/*.txt
# /data/
